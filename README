	libSMC
=====================
This package is a C++ library that aims to provide a simple way to manage a music library. The basic idea is that you let it create a database of files, and then you can tell it to either export a playlist, or retrieve it's internal list of files. Also, it can store the database to a XML file, for later use (you don't have to recreate the library each time).
It currently depends on:
	-TagLib: Used for reading file meta-data
	-libXML++: Used for the XML database
	-Glibmm: Used for string handling

Please report any bugs you encounter.
